HTML Note 
Section 2.3 Comments 

As a programmer in the real world, you’ll spend lots of time looking at
and editing other people’s code. And, other people will spend lots of
time looking at and editing your code. Therefore, everyone’s code needs
to be understandable. One key to understanding is good comments.
Comments are words that humans read but the computer skips. More
specifically, for web programming, the browser engine skips HTML
comments. The browser engine is the software inside a web browser
that reads a web page’s content (e.g., HTML code, image files) and
formatting information (CSS), and then displays the formatted content on
the screen.
Usually, HTML code is fairly easy to understand, so there is no need
for extensive comments.
However, sometimes comments are appropriate. The general rule is to
include a comment whenever information is needed to clarify something
about nearby HTML code. Here’s an example:
<!-- The following image should be updated once a month. -->
<img src="januaryPicture.gif" width="400" height="250">
In this code fragment, which displays a picture on a web page, the first
line is a comment. As you can see, to form a comment, surround
commented text with <!-- and --> markers. For comments that are short
enough to fit on one line, like above, proper style suggests inserting a
space immediately after <!-- and immediately before --> . This is an
appropriate comment because without it, it would be harder for the web
developer to remember to update the picture.For comments that are too long to fit on one line, proper style suggests
putting the
<!-- and -->
markers on lines by themselves and indenting the enclosed comment
text. Here’s an example:
<!—-
If the user clicks one of the color buttons, that will cause the
following paragraph's font color to change to the button's color.
-->
For the most part, HTML just enables you (the programmer) to display
stuff on your web page. JavaScript adds quite a bit of functionality by
enabling you to read user input and update what the web page displays.
In the world of software development, documentation refers to a
description of a program. That description can be in the form of a
document completely separate from the source code (like a user guide),
or it can be embedded in the source code itself. Comments are one
form of embedded code documentation. With HTML, meta elements
provide another form of embedded-code documentation. you should
normally always include a meta author element, so other people in your
company know whom to go to when questions arise (or whom to blame
when the boss needs a target). The meta description and meta keywords
elements are also popular, but not quite as popular as the meta author
element.
