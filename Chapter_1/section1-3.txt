➔ Formally, the website address value is known as a URL, which
stands for Uniform Resource Locator.

➔ The http refers to the hypertext transfer protocol, where a
protocol is a set of rules and formats for exchanging messages
between computers. After http comes a delimiter, :// , and then
the name of the web server computer that stores the web page.

➔ Next comes the domain that describes how the web server can be
found on the internet. For this example, the domain is park.edu .

➔ Next, there’s a sequence of directories and sub directories (also
called folders and sub folders) that indicate where the web page
is stored on the web server computer. That’s called the path.

➔ the address bar are web page elements— h1 , hr , p , and div.
The h1 element is used to implement a web page heading, with
the “h” in h1 standing for “heading.” The hr element is used to
implement a horizontal line, with the “h” and “r” standing.

➔ for “horizontal” and “rule,” respectively. The p element is used
to implement a paragraph. Finally, a div element is used to
group words together as part of a division within a web page.

➔ A web page’s elements hold the web page’s content, which is the
most important part of a web page. After deciding on which
elements to use and implementing those elements, you’ll want to
focus on formatting the content.
