WEB PROGRAMMING With HTML , CSS and JavaScript

CHAPTER 1

Section 1.2

A website is a collection of related web pages that are normally
stored on a single web server computer. A web server is a computer
system that enables users to access web pages stored on the web
server’s computer. The term “web server” can refer to the web page-
accessing software that runs on the computer, or it can refer to the
computer itself.

To create a website, you’ll need these things:
✔ a text editor
✔ an upload/publishing tool,
✔ a web hosting service,
✔ a browser. We’ll describe them in the upcoming paragraphs.
