WEB PROGRAMMING With HTML , CSS and JavaScript

CHAPTER 1

Section 1. 6 HTML Tags

✗ The head element contains two types of elements— meta and title.

✗ the head element surrounds elements associated with the web page as
a whole. The web page’s title pertains to the entire web page, so its
title element goes within the head container. 

The title element’scontained data specifies the label that appears in the browser
window’s title bar.

✗ The official HTML standard requires that every head container
contains a title element.

✗ Besides providing a label for your browser window’s title bar, what’s
the purpose of the title element?

✗ (1) It provides documentation for someone trying to maintain your
web page, and

✗ (2) it helps web search engines find your web page. In case you
haven’t heard of a web search engine, it’s software that searches the
Internet for user-specified information and returns a list of links to.


✗ web pages that are likely to contain the requested information.
Google is the preeminent search engine, as evidenced by the use of
“google” as a verb.
