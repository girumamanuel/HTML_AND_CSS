WEB PROGRAMMING With HTML , CSS and JavaScript

CHAPTER 1

Section 1. 4 HTML Tags

✗ To implement an element for a web page, you’ll need to use tags. For
example, if you want to implement a strong element (in order to put
emphasis on the element’s content and display using boldface),
surround the content with <strong> tags.

✗ The use of tags is the key characteristic of a markup language. Why
is it called “markup”? A markup language “marks up” a document
by surrounding parts of its content with tags . Web pages are
implemented with HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup
Language.

✗ The “hyper” in “Hypertext” refers to HTML’s ability to implement
hyperlinks.

✗ A hyperlink (or link for short) is where you click on text or an image
in order to jump to another web page. So HTML is a language that
supports markup tags for formatting and the ability to jump to other
web pages.

✗ There are two types of elements—container elements and void
elements. A container element (usually called simply a “container”)
has a start tag and an end tag, and it contains content between its
two tags.

✗ For example, the h1 element is a container. On the other hand, a
void element has just one tag, and its content is stored within the
tag.

✗ When a tag is discussed in general, without reference to a particular
tag instance, it is called an element and it is written without the
angled brackets. For example, when discussing the <h1> tag in
general, refer to it as the h1 element.
