WEB PROGRAMMING With HTML , CSS and JavaScript

CHAPTER 1

Section 1.1

Most people say “Web” instead of “World Wide Web,” and we’ll
follow that convention. The Web is a collection of documents, called
web pages, that are shared (for the most part) by computer users
throughout the world. Different types of web pages do different things,
but at a minimum, they all display content on computer screens.
By“content,”we mean text, pictures, and user input mechanisms like
text boxes and buttons.
Speaking of the Internet, what is it?
It’s a collection of several
billion computers connected throughout the world. Each web page is
stored on one of those computers.
