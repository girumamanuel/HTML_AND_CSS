WEB PROGRAMMING With HTML , CSS and JavaScript

CHAPTER 1

Section 1. 5 HTML Tags

✗ What’s source code, you ask? With many programming
languages, two types of code are associated with a single
program. There’s source code, which the programmer enters,
and there’s executable code, which is low-level code that the
computer hardware understands and executes (runs).
Executable code is generated from the source code with the
help of something called a compiler.

✗ HTML code is source code because HTML code comes
directly from the programming source—the programmer.

✗ The html , head , and body elements form the basic
structure of a web page, so we’ll refer to those elements as
structural elements .

✗ Be aware that that’s not a standard term. We made it up
because it will make future explanations easier.

✗ The first construct, <!DOCTYPE html> , tells the browser
what type of document the web page is. Its html value (in
<!DOCTYPE html> ) indicates that the document is anHTML document, and more specifically that the document
uses the HTML5 standard for its syntax. Syntax refers to the
words, grammar, and punctuation that make up a language.

✗ After the doctype instruction comes the html element. It’s a
container, and it contains/surrounds the rest of the web
page. Its start tag includes lang="en" , which tells the
browser that the web page is written in English. The head
and body elements are also containers. The head element
surrounds elements that provide information associated with
the web page as a whole. The body element surrounds
elements that display content in the web page.

✗ Container elements must be properly nested, meaning that if
you start a container inside another container, you must end
the inner container before you end the outer container.

✗ Because the body element starts inside the html element, the
</body> end tag must come before the </html> end tag.
note how the head and body elements are properly nested
within the html element.
